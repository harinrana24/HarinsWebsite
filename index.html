</div>
<p>A strategy game for 2 to 8 players.
  <br>
  The objective of Chain Reaction is to take control of the board by eliminating your opponents' orbs.
  <br>
  Players take it in turns to place their orbs in a cell. Once a cell has reached critical mass the orbs explode into the surrounding cells adding an extra orb and claiming the cell for the player. A player may only place their orbs in a blank cell
  or a cell that contains orbs of their own colour. As soon as a player looses all their orbs they are out of the game.
  <br>
  Game features both HD modes for larger (Pad) screens and the regular mode for all devices.
  <br>
  Each player can customise the colour & sounds of their orbs. A player can also turn tactile feedback (vibration) on and off.
  <br>
  <strong>I hope you have as much fun playing this as I have coding it.</strong>
